# Cube-Surfer
I developed a game called 'Cat Cube Explorer' using Unity and C#, which I released in the Huawei App Gallery. In this game, players can move the character left and right by swiping on the screen, collect and stack colorful cubes, and enjoy a customizable forward speed. The game features five different colored cubes and starts with the player having one cube, with the objective to stack more cubes as they move forward.
